# HLM-for-exploring-the-relationship-between-physical-activity-and-academic-achievement
A data-manipulation process that explores the relationship between physical activity and academic achievement in adolescents
Objectives and methods
## Research questions
- Question 1: How do factors related to physical activity at the student- and school-levels affect student achievement in math, reading, and science subjects?
- Question 2: How does the country-level of athletic success affect the impact on student achievement in math, reading, and science subjects?
- Question 3: How do school-level physical activity-related factors and national sports success moderate the relationship between student-level physical activity behaviors and their academic achievement?
## Methods
- Methods: Multilevel analysis
- Software: SPSS 26 for data preparation; HLM6 for multilevel linear regression
